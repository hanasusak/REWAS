# REWAS

---

In this repository are sequence of scripts to perform REWAS (Rare-variant Exome Wide Association Study).

To start you need two input files, multi-sample VCF-like file (with additional annotation, done by eDiVa) and Samples info file (tab separated, where Samples IDs are matching the one in multi-sample file). Additionaly you can add separete mutlis-sample file for InDels and samples IDs correction file (with mappings) in case some sample IDs are not matching in two before mentioned files.
